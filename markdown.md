# What is MarkDown

##### [Go Back Home](README.md)

## Headings
typing ' # ' one or more times before a title/heading controls the size of it.  


## Listing
* Adding a ' * ' before a list item adds a bullet point.
  * If you tabbed in then used the ' * ' then it'll be a nested list item and will show up as empty bullet point.  
  
  
## Styling
**Adding two ' * ' before and after a word/sentence will make it bold.**

*Adding one ' * ' before and after a word/sentence will make it italic.*

~~Adding two ' ~ ' before and after a word/sentence will strikethough it.~~    

### Nested Styling
**This text is not all _italic_ but bold**

***This text is all in italic and bold***  


## Quoting
If I am quoting text I can add ' > ' before it like:
> "This is fun!"
-Reema  

If I am quoting a code I can use triple backticks to format it into a block
```
# Python Code
print("Hello, World!")
```  
or a single backtick to use within a sentence like:

I always use `git status` before every git command.
