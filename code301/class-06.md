## Node, Express, and APIs

### Node.js

- **Node.js** is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

- The **V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.

  - It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

- The creator of Node **Ryan Dahl** took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

- **Node.js** is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.    
  
  
### Express.js

- **Express.js**, or simply **Express**, is a back end web application framework for Node.js.

- Released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.

- It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

- It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. 

- The **express** framework is built on top of the **node.js** framework and helps in fast-tracking development of server-based applications. 


### Application Programming Interface

- In computing, an **application programming interface** is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. 

- **API** is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

- It is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components, operating systems, or microservices. 
  
- An API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to a user.
