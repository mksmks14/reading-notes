## APIs continued

- **Purpose:** 
  - In building applications, an **API** *(application programming interface)* simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. 
  
- **Example:** 
  - While a **graphical interface** for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, 
  - an **API** for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.

- **REST:**
    - REST stands for **“Representational State Transfer”** and is the set of rules that developers follow when creating an API. 
    - REST is read using **JSON** *(JavaScript Object Notation)*. 
    - One of these rules is that the API should be designed in a way that is easy to use and will make sense for developers.
