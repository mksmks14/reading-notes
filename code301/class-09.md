### Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

- **Functional programming** is a *programming paradigm* â€” a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.
  
- Its goal is to treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

  - **Pure functions**: A pure function is a function where   
    - it returns the same result if given the same arguments *(it is also referred as deterministic)*.
    - It does not cause any observable side effects.
