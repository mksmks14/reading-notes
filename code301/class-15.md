## Diversity and Inclusion

- I decided that rather than having a sort of a negative outlook *(since facts are clear on how almost every single thing in our lives is biased)* I want to showcase some ways that 2021 could be a little bit less dreadful.

- **Change Brings More Change**
    - With the onset of the pandemic, companies across the board have had to be more flexible.
    - No longer limited to local hires, recruiters have a larger pool of potential talent from which to choose, which is broadening the field of possibilities for both applicants and employers. 
    - The flexibility of a remote environment helps some women who may have other responsibilities and now don’t have to worry about factoring in a commute. 

- **Diversity In The New Normal**
    - The fact is, digital interactions don’t allow for the same exchange as live environments.
    - Biases favoring the outspoken might diminish.
    - Businesses that may not have been able to accommodate gender-neutral restrooms or general access for disabled workers no longer have the limitations of a physical location. 
    - Just as remote working has expanded the reach of employment prospects, it opens doors for student internships that might otherwise not have been possible. 
    - By building confidence in young women and other underrepresented groups, we offer a path they might not otherwise have seen themselves traveling.
