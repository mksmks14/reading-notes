# What is JavaScript Loops

Continuing about **_JavaScript_** Syntax, this is how loops in code are represented:

## JavaScript Loops

- **For Loop**
  - for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3)
    {
        // code block to be executed
    }
    
      - Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

      - Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

      - Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

```
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
{
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```




- **While Loop**
