## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### HTML and CSS Review
- **Lists**
    - There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
    - Ordered lists use numbers.
    - Unordered lists use bullets.
    - Definition lists are used to define terminology.
    - Lists can be nested inside one another.
  
- **Boxes**
    - CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.
    - You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
    - You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
    - It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
    - Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
    - Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
    - CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
  

### JavaScript Review

- **Basic JavaScript Instructions**
    - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
    - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
    - JavaScript distinguishes between **numbers** (0-9), **strings** (text), and **Boolean** values (true or false).
    - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
    - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

- **Decisions and Loops**
    - Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
    - Comparison operators **(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)** are used to compare two operands.
    - Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
    - **if ... else** statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is **true**, and another if it is **false**.
    - **switch** statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes *(and also provides a default option if none match)*.
    - Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
    - All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
    - There are three types of loop: **for**, **while**, and **do ... while**. Each repeats a set of statements.
