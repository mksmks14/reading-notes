## Machine Learning Intro

- Machine learning *(ML)* is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
 
- It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

- Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

- Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

- **Data wrangling**:

  - Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.

  - The goal of data wrangling is to assure quality and useful data. 

  - Data analysts typically spend the majority of their time in the process of data wrangling compared to the actual analysis of the data.

  - The process of data wrangling may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses.

  - Data wrangling typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data *(e.g. sorting)* or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.


**Python Data Wrangling Steps:**

1. Set up your environment.
2. Import libraries and dataset.
3. Understand the data.
4. Filter unwanted observations.
5. Pivot the dataset.
6. Shift the pivoted dataset.
7. Melt the shifted dataset.
8. Reduce-merge the melted data.
9. Aggregate with group-by.
