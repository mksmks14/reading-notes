## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### HTML and CSS Review
- **Text**
    - HTML elements are used to describe the **structure** of the page *(e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs)*.
    - They also provide **semantic** information *(e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)*.
  
- **Introducing CSS**
    - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
    - Rules are made up of selectors *(that specify the elements the rule applies to)* and declarations *(that indicate what these elements should look like)*.
    - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
    - Declarations are made up of two parts: the **properties** of the element that you want to change, and the **values** of those properties. For example, the `font-family` property sets the choice of font, and the value `arial` specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
    - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
  

### JavaScript Review

- **Basic JavaScript Instructions**
    - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
    - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
    - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
    - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
    - JavaScript distinguishes between **numbers** (0-9), **strings** (text), and **Boolean** values (true or false).
    - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
    - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

- **Decisions and Loops**
    - Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
    - Comparison operators **(===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)** are used to compare two operands.
    - Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
    - **if ... else** statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is **true**, and another if it is **false**.
    - **switch** statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes *(and also provides a default option if none match)*.
    - Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
    - All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
    - There are three types of loop: **for**, **while**, and **do ... while**. Each repeats a set of statements.
