## HTML Review
- Structure
    - HTML p XX ages are text documents.
    - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
    - Tags are often referred to as elements.
    - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
    - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
    - Attributes require a name and a value.
    - To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
  
- Extra Markup
    - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
    - You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
    - The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
    - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
    - <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
    - The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
    - Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
  
- HTML5 Layout
    - The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
    - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
    - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
    - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

- Process & Design
    - It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
    - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
    - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
    - Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
    - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
    - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


## JavaScript Review

- The ABC of Programming
    - Computers create models of the world using data.
    - The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
    - Programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."
    - Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind object).
    - To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
