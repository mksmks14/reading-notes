## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### HTML and CSS Review
- **Links**
    - Links are created using the `<a>` element.
    - The `<a>` element uses the **href** attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
    - If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
    - You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "**to**" field.
    - You can use the **id** attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
  
- **Layout**
    - `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
    - Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify **relative**, **absolute**, or **fixed** positioning.
    - The **float** property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. *(Floated items require a defined width.)*
    - Pages can be fixed **width** or **liquid** *(stretchy)* layouts.
    - Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels *(to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).*
    - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
    - CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
    - You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
  

### JavaScript Review

- **Functions, Methods, and Objects**
    - Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
    - Functions can take **parameters** *(informatiorn required to do their job)* and may **return** a value.
    - An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
    - In an object, variables are known as **properties** of the object; functions are known as **methods** of the object.
    - Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
    - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as **String**, **Number**, **Math**, and **Date**. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
    - Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets *(and both can contain the other)*.

- **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
    - Greater efficiency.
    - Engaged collaboration.
    - Learning from fellow students.
    - Social skills.
    - Job interview readiness.
    - Work environment readiness.
