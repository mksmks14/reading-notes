## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team  
  
- We had imagined that building an effective team would be like solving a puzzle – that the best teams would be those where outstanding individuals were put to work together.   
- We even thought that there might be an opportunity to create a new algorithm that could predict how to assemble perfect teams.  
  
- Instead, the researchers found something incredibly surprising. At Google, who is on a team matters much less than how team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions.   
- And across all types of teams, from Sales to Engineering, from San Francisco to Singapore, five dynamics consistently differentiated top-performing teams from those at the bottom.  
  
### The 5 dynamics of an effective team:  
   
1. #### Psychological safety:  

   - This was the single most important dynamic in an effective team. Psychological safety is about risk-taking and being comfortable with vulnerability. People who don’t feel psychologically safe worry that taking risks will mean they’re seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative or disruptive. Psychological safety means feeling confident about admitting mistakes, asking questions, or offering new ideas.

2. #### Dependability:  

   - On dependable teams, members reliably complete quality work on time. They don’t avoid their responsibilities and they take them seriously, helping to keep the team on track. As simple as it sounds, this turned out to be vital for effectiveness in teams.

3. #### Structure and Clarity:  

    - This means that a team has clear roles, goals and plans. Individuals understand what’s expected of them, what they and their team is aiming for and how they are all going to get there. Google often uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to help set and communicate specific, challenging and attainable short- and long-term goals, at an individual and at a group level.
  
4. #### Meaning:  

    - For individuals on a team, finding a sense of purpose in their work or its output is vitally important for team effectiveness. That meaning is personal, so it varies from person to person, but might include financial security, their ability to support their family, their commitment to the success of the team, or their individual self-expression.
  
5. #### Impact:  

    - Do you fundamentally believe that the work you do makes a difference? This subjective judgment marks out the most effective teams and can be based on seeing how one’s work contributes to an organization’s goals and what it has helped to change.
