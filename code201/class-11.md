## Audio, Video, Images and Flash

### Images    

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.  
  This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.    
  
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.    

- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.    

- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.    

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.    

- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.    


### Practical Information    

- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.    

- Analytics tools such as **Google Analytics** allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.     
  
- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.    

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.    

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools *(to save you writing them from scratch).*      


#### Flash    

- Flash is a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to websites.    

- Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.    

- Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
